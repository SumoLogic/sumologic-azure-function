# Sumo Logic Azure Blob Storage Integration
This contains the function to read from an Azure Blob Storage, then forward data to a Sumo Logic.

## About the Configuration Process
Sumo provides an Azure Resource Management (ARM) template to build most of the components in the pipeline. The template creates:

* An event hub to which Azure Event Grid routes create block blobs events.
* A Service Bus for storing tasks.
* Three Azure functions â€” TaskProducer, TaskConsumer, and DLQTaskConsumer that are responsible for sending monitoring data to Sumo.
* A storage account to which the Azure functions write their log messages about successful and failed transmissions.

## For Developers

### Code structure

Currently ARM template is integrated with github and for each functions build folder is present in `BlockBlobReader/target` directory

* BlockBlobReader/target/producer_build/BlobTaskProducer - Function for Creating tasks(json object with start and end bytes).
* BlockBlobReader/target/consumer_build/BlobTaskConsumer - Function for Downloading block blobs and ingesting to Sumo
* BlockBlobReader/target/dlqprocessor_build/BlobTaskConsumer -  Function for retrying failed tasks.

### Updating target directory

Make all the code changes in `BlockBlobReader/src` directory, once all the changes are completed, run below command to update target directory.

`npm run build`

This command copies required files in `BlockBlobReader/target` directory

Integrations tests are in `BlockBlobReader/tests` folder and unit tests are in `sumo-function-utils/tests` folder

### Run Integration Tests

Integrations tests are in `BlockBlobReader/tests` folder and unit tests are in sumo-`function-utils/tests` folder

Modify the run_integration_test.sh file with below parameters

```console
