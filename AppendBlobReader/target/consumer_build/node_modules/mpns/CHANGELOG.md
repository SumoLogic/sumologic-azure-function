# MPNS: Changelog

This document has been superceded by the built-in GitHub releases feature. Find out more about release notes and changes at https://github.com/jeffwilcox/mpns/releases

## 2.x

2.0.1:

* Contains a compatibility fix (thanks @yavorg) allowing for an older broken property case name, `smallbackgroundImage` to be translated to `smallBackgroundImage`.

2.0.0:

* createTile, createFlipTile, createToast, createRaw functions separate from send functions.
* BREAKING CHANGE: Removes the very old liveTile, toast, rawNotification class types exposed by the module. To use this functionality for legacy apps, simply use any npm version prior to 2.0.0. The latest known version before the change was 1.2.8.
* Increments the npm version to 2.0.0 to signal breaking change. Note that there is no major new functionality other than breaking change and an incrementally better implementation, unit tests, etc.
